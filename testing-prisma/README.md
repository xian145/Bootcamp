# Prisma

In this project we'll working with prisma, implemented in next.js, so we initialize a projecte with next.js

$npx create-next-app@latest tryprisma

this will create a project named "tryprisma" so prisma is not install yet, to install primsa we change to the project folder and use:

$npm install -D prisma

with this now we can initiate prisma in the terminal using:

```
npx prisma
```
